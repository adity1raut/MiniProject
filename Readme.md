---

## **1. Abstract**

With the rapid growth of remote work, online education, and digital collaboration, there is a growing demand for intelligent real-time communication platforms. Traditional chat and video conferencing applications provide messaging and video calls but lack intelligent features such as conversation understanding, moderation, summarization, and productivity insights.

This project presents an **AI-Powered Real-Time Chat and Group Video Communication Application** that enables users to **create groups, exchange messages, and conduct real-time group video calls**, enhanced with **artificial intelligence**. The system integrates **real-time chat, group video conferencing, AI-driven message analysis, smart reply suggestions, conversation summarization, and AI-based moderation**.

The application is designed using modern web technologies and follows an **industry-level, scalable architecture**, making it suitable for enterprise collaboration, education, and community communication platforms.

## **2. Problem Statement**

Existing communication platforms suffer from the following limitations:

* Lack of intelligent understanding of chat conversations
* No AI-assisted moderation in group chats
* Difficulty managing long group discussions and meetings
* Absence of automated meeting summaries and insights
* Limited integration between chat and video communication

In group-based environments such as teams, classrooms, and communities, unmanaged conversations and meetings often lead to miscommunication, reduced productivity, and safety issues. Therefore, there is a need for a **smart communication platform** that combines **group chat, group video calling, and AI intelligence** in a single system.
